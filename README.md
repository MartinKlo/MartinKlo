Hey everyone!

I use Github as a way to store my work and coordinate projects with others. Feel free to check out some of my previous coursework, or get updated on some of my current projects. Here's some information about me:
- I graduated with a Bachelor's of Sociology in December 2024, with minors in data science, informatics (geospatial data specialization), and philosophy. I am about to start my Master's in Information Systems at Dakota State University
- My main interests are in computational social science and working with data (data engineering, analysis, and visualization). I am particularly interested in modeling and simulations.
- The main languages I'm working on are R and Javascript. Other languages I'm working on are SQL, Python, HTML, and CSS. Some experience in Git, Bash, and C.
- Mainly focused on learning more about models and simulations, as well as improving code design. I expect work in the near future to reflect this and my Masters research.
