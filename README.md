Hey everyone!

I use Github as a way to store my work and coordinate projects with others. Feel free to check out some of my previous coursework, or get updated on some of my current projects. Here's some information about me:
- I graduated with a Bachelor's of Sociology in December 2024, with minors in data science, informatics (geospatial data specialization), and philosophy. Right now I'm looking at grad school programs in Data Science, STS/Information Sciences, and Sociology.
- My main interests are in social science and working with data (data engineering, analysis, and visualization). Especially focused on creating datasets, creating data piplines, and data wrangling because of what stage several projects are in.
- The main languages I'm working on are R and Javascript. Other languages I'm working on are SQL, Python, HTML, and CSS. Some experience in Git, Bash, and C.
- Currently working on overhauling the infrastructure for a sim league I am apart of. In the near future I am planning on revising old coursework and working through an econometrics textbook I picked up.
