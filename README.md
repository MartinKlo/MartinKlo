Hey everyone!
- My main interests are in social science and working with data (data engineering, analysis, and visualization)
- The main languages I'm working on are R and Javascript. Other languages I'm working on are SQL, Python, HTML, and CSS.
- Currently working on overhauling the infrastructure for a sim league I am apart of. In the near future I am planning on revising old coursework and working through an econometrics textbook I picked up.
